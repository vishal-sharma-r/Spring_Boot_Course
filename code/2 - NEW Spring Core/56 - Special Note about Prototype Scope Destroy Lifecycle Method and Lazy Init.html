<h4>Prototype Beans and Destroy Lifecycle</h4><p>There is a subtle point you need to be aware of with "prototype" scoped beans.</p><p><strong>For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the destroy method. Gasp! </strong><br></p><p>---</p><p><strong><em>In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a prototype bean</em></strong><em>: the container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a prototype object, and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype instance.</em></p><p><em>Thus, although initialization lifecycle callback methods are called on all objects regardless of scope, </em><strong><em>in the case of prototypes, configured destruction lifecycle callbacks are not called</em></strong><em>. The client code must clean up prototype-scoped objects and release expensive resources that the prototype bean(s) are holding.</em></p><p><br></p><h4>Prototype Beans and Lazy Initialization</h4><p>Prototype beans are lazy by default. There is no need to use the @Lazy annotation for prototype scopes beans.</p>
